# odin-recipes
I am creating a recipes page based on what I have learnt so far in the introduction to html in the odin curriculum, the idea is to test my understanding of simple html usage like the anchor element, the image element and the link, as well as knowing how to use list element, which includes ordered list and unordered list. Also, I want to be able to write an html from the <!DOCTYPE html> down to the last line in order to build my muscle memory.
