      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li> Heat pasta water:
          Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 Tbsp of salt for every 2 quarts of water). While the water is heating, start making the sauce.</li> 
          <li> 
            <p>Cook onions, anchovies, garlic:      Heat the olive oil over medium heat in a large, deep saut√© pan. When the oil is hot, cook the onions until they're soft and translucent, about 4-5 minutes.</p>
            <p>While the onions are cooking, stir in the chopped anchovies along with some of the oil from the can.</p>
            <p>Add the finely chopped garlic and cook another minute.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Make the sauce:Mix in the tomato paste and cook it for 2 minutes, stirring occasionally.Add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, chili pepper flakes, olives, and capers. Bring the sauce to a simmer, then lower the heat to low to maintain a gentle simmer, 10 to 15 minutes</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Cook the spaghetti:When the salted pasta water is at a rolling boil, add the pasta. Cook the pasta according to the package instructions, to al dente, cooked but still slightly firm.</p>
          </li>
          <li> 
            <p>Finish the sauce:Stir the parsley into the pasta sauce. Add some pasta water into the sauce to thin it if it has become too thick.</p>
          </li>
          <li><p> Serve:Drain the pasta and put in a large bowl. If you want, mix a little olive oil into the pasta so the pasta doesn't stick together.</p>
            
          <p>Add a ladle's worth of sauce to the pasta and mix to combine. Serve in shallow bowls with more sauce on top.</p>
          </li>
